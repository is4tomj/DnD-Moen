# Test of the smoking eye -- March 10, 2019.

`Jenny` tells us about`Cage Rites`. which build something called soul cages. We don't know what they are or do. `Jennya` believes the cage that we saw in Red Gourge may have been a soul cage made by `Cage Rites`.

We are going back to get to the cage. We are taking beasts of burden with us to carry the cage (7 ft.) back with us.

We are in a boat, which we left a deposit for, and we started to hear tremendous houling. Once we got to shore and started down the trail, we see three demonic apes with glowing eyes.

As we defeated the deamon apes, we were suddenly assisted by a wizard named `Karophan`. He is cloacked and has a staff. He says he has been sent by the `Smoking Eye` to the outer plane of `Occupidus`. He will serve a guide.

The plain of `Occupidus` is a plane of the abiss that was involved in a gigantic celestial battle. At the end of the battle, a portion of `Celestia` crashed down on the plane making Occupidus both evil and good. The `Smoking Eye` is the symbol that represents `Occupidus`.

We made a deal with `Karophan` to send the soul cage back to `Jennya`. In return, we will let him teleport us to `Occupidus` to begin the trials of the `Smoking Eye`.

We get back to where we saw the soul cage, but the soul cage is gone and the fire giant is dead. `Karophan` says that he took the soul cage and he will not give it to `Jennya` until we complete the test of the `Smoking Eye`.

We use the `scroll of sending` to talk to `Jennya` and tell her what happened. `Jennya` tells us that we should proceed with extreme caution when dealing with `Karophan`.

`Karophan` gives us three scrolls of shift to leave `Occupidus` when we want. He teleports us to `Occupidus`.

## Occupidus

Off in the distance, we see a small rise with a structure that appears to be a ruin of some kind. We have 108 miles to get to the ruins.

We came across a Gray Slaad. We see it and begin to attack. Just before we were able to kill it, the Gray Slaad teleports to a different plane.

`Karophan` has a carpet of flying, which will take 4 of us, and we have a flying beatle that will take 2 of us, so we start flying to our destination. We get most of the way there to a place called `Ausiac Forest`, with big bones sticking out of the ground. We found a new Green Slaad.

After a short fight, the Green Slaad turns invisible. We cannot determine where it went.

We decide to camp for the night before we get to the `Fiberous Forest`. On Elana's watch, she was practicing her moves and accidentally hit the `Green Slaad` while invisible and it fell over dead.

We come to stone doors of the `Cathedral of Feathers`. The stone is different than any stone we have seen, but does not appear to be magical. We did see two dryders.

`Elaina` was turned invisible by our Bard. She used her spider boots to climb to the top and sniped both dryders.



# Red Gourge -- January 2019

Alex Tersival is dead.

Alex told us to stay away from Caulderon and "Trust the smoking eye if you wish to save everyone that we love".
